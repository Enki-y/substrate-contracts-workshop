# Substrate Contracts Workshop

This is a self-guided tutorial which will teach you how to build [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/) smart contracts on [Parity Substrate] using [Parity ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/).

This workshop is still under development, and we plan to write additional content:

 - ERC721 Contract
 - Some non-token contract (undetermined)

We would love for you to give feedback in these early stages, so open an issue or a PR!
