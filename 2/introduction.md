In this chapter, we will show you how you can build an ERC20 token contract with ink!.

Over the course of the chapter, we will cover:

- Initial token minting
- Token transfers
- Approvals and third party transfers
- Emitting runtime events through Substrate

But first, we will go over the ERC20 standard for those of you who are not familiar.
